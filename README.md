## Description
Meme economy, we got the inspiration from: `https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/`

## Running a demo test
`Format` and `Template` words are used interchangeably across the project and they mean the same thing.
Check the `memes folder` to see examples of different `templates` and `memes` created using the `templates`.

### 1. Requirements
- `Flask`==1.1.2, run `pip install Flask==1.1.2` to install it.
- `requests`==2.23.0, run `pip install requests==2.23.0` to install it.
- `Postman` HTTP Client, download it from: `https://www.getpostman.com/`

We are using `Postman` for better visualization of the input/output data. Of course, using `curl` via the command line would produce the same results, but visualization of images(memes) would not be possible.
Use `Postman` for running the demo below.

### 2. Parameters
The default parameters' values are as follows:

`MIN_TRANSACTIONS` = 1

Sets the minimum number of transactions needed inside the memory pool to start auto mining.

`AUTOMATIC_MINING` = True

If set to `True`, mining of new blocks is automatic.
If set to `False`, mining of new blocks is manual.
(described in more details below in point 6)

`DEBUG_PRINTS` = False

If set to `True`, more detailed info for debugging/tracking will be printed on the terminal

To change the value of the 3 parameters above check inside `flask_app.py`

`difficultyPattern` = `0000`

Our current difficulty pattern is `0000` and mining of a new block takes no more than few seconds. To change this value check inside `blockchain.py`

`NEW_NODE_INITIAL_CREDITS` = 5

The amount of initial credits each node receive after connecting to the network. To change this value check inside `validation.py`

### 3. Initialization of the Peer-to-Peer Network
All of the peers are currently running on the local network. The `core` node must run on port `5000` in order to initialize the network.

1. Run `flask_app.py` in at least 2 different Terminals with different ports as an input.
- T1: `py flask_app.py 5000`
- T2: `py flask_app.py 5001`

2. Open `Postman` and create a `POST` request by using the `connect_to_node` method to the second node and by providing the address of the `core` node in raw-JSON format in the Body of the request. The request URL in our case is: `http://127.0.0.1:5001/connect_to_node` with body input: `{"node_address":"http://127.0.0.1:5000/"}`. If the connection is successful the response will be `Connection successful` with status code 200. 

Future peers will be able to connect to the established network by sending a connection request to any of the already connected peers in the network. 

##### Events triggered after a new peer is connected:
- The new peer receives a copy of the blockchain and pending transactions of its connector (the peer accepting the connection request)
- All other peers in the network are notified about the newly connected peer

### 4. Creating transactions (NOT FINISHED COMPLETELY YET)
##### We currently support 5 different transaction types: 
- `/add_memeFormat`     - Used to add a new meme format to the network
- `/add_meme`           - Used to add a new meme to the network
- `/add_upvote`         - Used to upvote a meme inside the network
- `/sell_ownership`     - Used to sell the ownership of a meme format
- `/purchase_ownership` - Used to buy the ownership of a meme format

##### Raw-JSON body input formats of transactions:
- `/add_memeFormat`

{"imagePath" : "imagePathValue", "name" : "nameValue"}

`Input format will be explained soon!`

- `/add_meme`

{"imagePath" : "imagePathValue", "name" : "nameValue", "memeFormat" : "memeFormatID"}

`Input format will be explained soon!`

- `/add_upvote`

{"imageVoteId":"memeID", "upvoteID" : "upvoteID"}

`Input format will be explained soon!`

- `/sell_ownership`

{"ownershipSaleOfferID" : "ownershipSaleOfferID", "memeFormat" : "memeFormatID", "saleAmount" : "saleAmount"}

`Input format will be explained soon!`

- `/purchase_ownership`

{"ownershipPurchaseID" : "ownershipPurchaseID", "ownershipSaleOfferID" : "ownershipSaleOfferID"}

`Input format will be explained soon!`

##### Events triggered after a new transaction is added:
- All other peers are notified for the newly added transaction
- All other peers validate and append the new transaction to their memory pool
- All peers start mining a block if there are 

##### Example Scenario of transactions: 

`Example scenario of transactions will be included for better understanding of the "value" and "ID" fields of the inputs.`


### 5. Printing all pending transactions
To check all pending transactions in the pool, it is enough to make a `GET` request by using the `/get_pending_transactions` method to any of the connected peers.
It is possible to get an empty list in case a block is mined and no other transaction is created before checking the list.

### 6. Mining a new block
Mining of a new block, on default, is an automatic process. 

Switching between auto and manual mode is possible with `AUTOMATIC_MINING` parameter.

`Auto Mining` - As soon as there are `MIN_TRANSACTIONS` amount of transactions inside the memory pool, all connected peers will start trying to mine a block. 

`Manual Mining` - Mining of a new block could also be a manual process triggered with a `GET` request by using the `/mine_block` method to any of the connected peers. Once a peer receives mining request, it will try to find a matching `nonce` value. Once a block is mined, all other peers will be notified. The manual mode is for testing purposes only and for better tracking of everything happening on the blockchain network.


##### Events triggered after a new block is mined:
- The miner checks if it has the longest valid chain (consensus mechanism)
- The miner adds the newly mined block to its local chain (if in consensus)
- All other peers are notified for the newly mined block
- All other peers validate the newly mined block and if the validation is successful they add the block to their local chains

### 7. Other useful RESTful methods
The following methods could be used on any peer.

##### 7.1 Printing the chain
Send a `GET` request by using the `/get_chain` method.

##### 7.2 Checking the validity of the chain
Send a `GET` request by using the `/check_validity` method.

##### 7.3 Checking all meme formats' and meme's information inside the network
Send a `GET` request by using the `/memeformats` method to any of the connected peers. The input format is: `{"info" : "booleanValue"}` (The input is not a must, it is optional). If the `booleanValue` is set to `True`, a more detailed information will be printed.

##### 7.4 Visualization of meme formats and memes
Send a `GET` request by using the `/visualize_meme` method. The input format is: `{"imageId" : "idValue"}`, where the `idValue` is in format `A_B`. `A` is the `port number` of the node which uploaded the meme and `B` is the `nameValue` of the meme.

Send a `GET` request by using the `/visualize_memeFormat` method. The input format is: `{"memeformatId" : "idValue"}`, where the `idValue` is in format `A_B`. `A` is the `port number` of the node which uploaded the memeFormat and `B` is the `nameValue` of the meme format.


The response in `Postman` will be an html code. To see the image, switch the response body view from `Pretty` to `Preview`

##### 7.5 Checking the credit balance of a node
Send a `GET` request by using the `/get_node_credits` method. The input format is: `{"nodeId" : "idValue"}`, where the `idValue` is the `port number` of that node.

### 8. Credits and rewards distribution system (NOT FINISHED COMPLETELY YET)

`Brief explanation of the credits and rewards distribution system will be included.`
